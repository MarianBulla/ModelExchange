# Introduction

Tensile test simulations provide a valuable means of verification and validation of material models before proceeding to more complex component level or system level simulations

Examples are provided here for the characterization of steel material data for OpenRadioss using Material Laws 2 and 36 with and without strain rate dependency and introduce the concept of triaxiality when considering failure.
